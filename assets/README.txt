Assets guide
============

Drop your art into these folders:

1) Backgrounds: place a file at `assets/backgrounds/select_bg.jpg` (or .png).
   The app will use it for the screen background.

2) Map: place a file at `assets/map/world_map.png` (transparent PNG recommended).
   The app will show it inside the oval.

3) Portraits (optional large): if you have bigger art separate from thumbnails,
   put them in `assets/portraits/`. Name to match roster ids, e.g. `guile.png`.

4) Fonts: if you have a TTF/OTF font, drop it in `assets/fonts/` and set
   the filename in `styles.css` under the `@font-face` block.

Recommended thumbnail size: 128x128 or 160x160. Portraits: square 512-1024.
