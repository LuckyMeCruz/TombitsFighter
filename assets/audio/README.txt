Audio assets
============

Expected files (you can change names if you update index.html):

- bgm/menu.mp3   (menu background music)
- bgm/select.mp3 (select screen background music)
- sfx/move.wav   (cursor move)
- sfx/confirm.wav (confirm selection)
- sfx/coin.wav   (coin insert)

Recommended: keep files short and loopable. Volume is controlled by the audio files themselves.
